## Overview

NAME (TBD) is a fast paced 2.5D top-down game where 4 players race around a procedurally generated home, collecting items for a scavenger hunt. The first to collect (X) items WINS!

Name ideas:
  Hare and Hounds (synonym for scavenger hunt)
    We could have College Edition / PreSchool Edition
    Each one would have items to collect dedicated to that age group (Future version)
    
Further Conceptualization:
  The "win zone" can be the person running the scavenger hunt that you have to return the item to. Maybe they could show you what the item you'll collect is in the beginning and then players can run off frantically (this could cover the loading of our scene).
  
  A small victory scene after each round was recommended, so we could implement that and a better total victory screen.
