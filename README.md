## Overview

NAME (TBD) is a 2D top-down game where 4 players explore a procedurally generated house. Each character has access to different entryways and they must work together to open up as many rooms as possible to find the 3 keys to escape; however, there is an increasing chance that a player will become a traitor as the game goes on, changing their goals to stopping the other three players from escaping.
